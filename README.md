# hacker_news_api ruby 

 Hacker News makes the public their data available in near real time.
> The v0 API is essentially a dump of our in-memory data structures. We know, what works great locally in memory isn't so hot over the network. Many of the awkward things are just the way HN works internally... It's not the ideal public API, but it's the one we could release in the time we had
